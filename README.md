# Homeautomation

#INTRODUCTION
This project mainly focuses on controlling of home appliances remotely. The system is CALL
based and uses wireless technology to revolutionize the standards of living. This system provides
ideal solution to the problems faced by home owners in daily life. The system is wireless
therefore more adaptable and cost-effective.
This system provides security against intrusion as well as automates various home appliances
using CALL. The system uses GSM technology to automate appliance control.
There was a need to automate home so that user can take advantage of the technological
advancement in such a way that a person getting off the office does not get melted with the hot
climate. Therefore this project proposes a system that allows user to control home appliances
via CALL using GSM technology.

#GSM
GSM stands for Global System for Mobile Communication and is an open, digital cellular
technology used for transmitting mobile voice and data services. The GSM emerged from the
idea of cell-based mobile radio systems at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s.The GSM is the
name of a standardization group established in 1982 to create a common European mobile
telephone standard. The GSM standard is the most widely accepted standard and is implemented
globally. The GSM is a circuit-switched system that divides each 200 kHz channel into eight 25
kHz time-slots. GSM operates in the 900MHz and 1.8GHz bands in Europe and the 1.9GHz and
850MHz bands in the US. The GSM is owning a market share of more than 70 percent of the
world's digital cellular subscribers.
The GSM makes use of narrowband Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique for
transmitting signals. The GSM was developed using digital technology. It has an ability to carry
64 kbps to 120 Mbps of data rates. Presently GSM supports more than one billion mobile
subscribers in more than 210 countries throughout the world. The GSM provides basic to
advanced voice and data services including Roaming service. Roaming is the ability to use your
GSM phone number in another GSM network. A GSM digitizes and compresses data, then sends
it down through a channel with two other streams of user data, each in its own time slot. It
operates at either the 900 MHz or 1,800 MHz frequency band.
The GSM study group aimed to provide the followings through the GSM:
   * Improved spectrum efficiency.
   * International roaming.
   * Low-cost mobile sets and base stations (BSS).
   * High-quality speech.
   * Compatibility with Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and other telephone company services.
   * Support for new services.
